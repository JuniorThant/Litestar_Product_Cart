This project is my python Litestar API small project which include the features of
    1. Add Product
    2. Retrieve All Products
    3. Retrieve Product By ID
    4. Delete Product By ID
    5. Increase Product Quantity
    6. Decrease Product Quantity

I tested API with Postman and it is working as expected. As a database, I used Mongo DB to store No-SQL data.
